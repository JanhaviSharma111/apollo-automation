# apollo-automation
This toolkit generates personalized outreach emails with Gemini and sends them in bulk via Gmail SMTP. Use apollo.py to draft emails from a contact list, then send_emails_smtp.py to deliver them.

Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed.
Gmail account with 2FA and an App Password for SMTP (regular passwords will fail).
Google Generative AI API key (set as GOOGLE_API_KEY).
Contact list as CSV or Excel with at least these columns: First Name, Last Name, Email. Optional columns used for personalization: Title, Company Name, Industry, Keywords, Website, Email Status.
Setup
Get the code locally (clone or download this folder).
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas google-generativeai python-dotenv openpyxl
Add your Google API key to .env in the project root:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
Prepare your contacts spreadsheet (CSV or Excel). Keep the required columns and fill optional fields for better personalization. Avoid rows with missing emails; the generator will skip them.
Obtain required keys:
Google Generative AI key (Gemini): Go to https://cloud.google.com/, create an API key, and copy it into .env as GOOGLE_API_KEY.
Gmail App Password: In your Google Account > Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords, generate a 16-character password for "Mail" on "Windows" (or any device). Use this App Password when prompted by the sender script. Regular Gmail passwords will fail.
Generate outreach emails (apollo.py)
Run the generator:
python apollo.py
When prompted:
Provide the path to your contacts file (CSV/XLSX/XLS).
Choose whether to customize the email template. If you answer "no", the built-in 180DC IIT Kharagpur template is used. If "yes", you can supply your own description, tone, key points, and template text (placeholders like $FIRST_NAME, $LAST_NAME, $COMPANY, $EMAIL_BODY are supported).
The script will:
Load and validate contacts (warns about missing/invalid emails).
Generate a short company-specific subject and body per contact using Gemini (model models/gemini-2.5-flash).
Save results to generated_emails.json (for automation) and generated_emails.txt (for quick review).
Optional: view a sample email when prompted.
Change the sender name/title (apollo.py)
The default template introduces Parth Sethi, Executive Head. To change the sender identity for another user:

Quick run-time change: When asked "Do you want to customize the email template?", answer yes and paste a new template that uses your own name/title. Example:
Respected $TITLE $LAST_NAME,

I am Your Name, Your Role at 180 Degrees Consulting, IIT Kharagpur. $EMAIL_BODY

Best regards,
Your Name
Your Role
IFSA, IIT Kharagpur
Permanent change: Edit default_template_info["template"] (and optionally description/key_points) near the top of apollo.py to set new defaults before running.
Output format (generated_emails.json)
Each entry looks like:

{
  "contact": "First Last",
  "email_address": "user@example.com",
  "subject": "180DC IIT Kharagpur X ExampleCo",
  "generated_email": "Respected Dr Last,\n...\nBest regards,\nParth Sethi\n..."
}
This file is the input for the sender script.

Send emails via Gmail SMTP (send_emails_smtp.py)
Ensure generated_emails.json is present in the project root (created by apollo.py).
Run the sender:
python send_emails_smtp.py
First run will create credentials.py. Enter:
Gmail address (defaults to parthsethi@180dc.org if you press Enter).
Gmail App Password (create in Google Account > Security > App passwords).
The script:
Imports credentials from credentials.py.
Uses CC recipients hardcoded in the script (arghyadip.pal@180dc.org, mishra.moulik@180dc.org). Edit cc_emails in send_emails_smtp.py if you want to change these.
Reads all messages from generated_emails.json.
Sends a test email to your own address to verify SMTP login.
Asks for confirmation (Do you want to send X emails?). Type yes to proceed.
Sends each email with a 2-second delay to respect Gmail rate limits. Successes and failures are printed, and a summary is shown at the end.
Tips and troubleshooting
Gmail SMTP requires an App Password (not your normal password). If the test email fails, regenerate an App Password and update credentials.py.
If Gemini returns an error, verify GOOGLE_API_KEY in .env and your network access. Model name is set to models/gemini-2.5-flash in apollo.py.
Make sure your contacts file path is correct and includes the required columns; missing emails are skipped.
Review generated_emails.txt before sending if you want to spot-check tone or personalization.
